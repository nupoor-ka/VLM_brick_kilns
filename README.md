# Bench-marking Vision Language Models on Detecting Brick Kilns in Satellite Imagery

### Evaluated the performance of various vision-language models (VLMs) in detecting brick kilns, small, dispersed objects, in low-resolution satellite imagery. Explored techniques like super-resolution, image slicing, and model fine-tuning to improve detection accuracy.
